App directory placeholder

This repository currently contains only compiled Python bytecode under `__pycache__` for this
directory. Source files (.py) are not present in the workspace.

If you want the actual application source committed, add the Python files (for example
`database.py`, `routers/*.py`, `models/*.py`, `schemas/*.py`) into this folder and push again.

Until then this README ensures the `app/` directory is present on the remote.
